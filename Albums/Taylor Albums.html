    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>Don't blame me, love made me crazy
    <br/>If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
    <br/>Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
    <br/>I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
    <br/>I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and
    <br/>Toyin' with them older guys
    <br/>Just playthings for me to use
    <br/>Something happened for the first time, in
    <br/>The darkest little paradise
    <br/>Shakin, pacin', I just need you
    <br/>For you, I would cross the line
    <br/>I would waste my time
    <br/>I would lose my mind
    <br/>They say, "She's gone too far this time"
    <br/>Don't blame me, love made me crazy
    <br/>If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
    <br/>Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
    <br/>I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
    <br/>Don't blame me, love made me crazy
    <br/>If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
    <br/>Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
    <br/>I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
    <br/>My name is whatever you decide
    <br/>And I'm just gonna call you mine
    <br/>I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)
    <br/>Echoes (echoes) of your name inside my mind
    <br/>Halo, hiding my obsession
    <br/>I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy
    <br/>And baby, for you, I (I) would (would) fall from grace
    <br/>Just (just) to (to) touch your face
    <br/>If (if) you (you) walk away
    <br/>I'd beg you on my knees to stay
    <br/>Don't blame me, love made me crazy
    <br/>If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
    <br/>Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
    <br/>I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (yeah, ooh)
    <br/>Don't blame me, love made me crazy
    <br/>If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
    <br/>Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
    <br/>I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
    <br/>I get so high, oh
    <br/>Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
    <br/>You're lovin' me
    <br/>Trip of my life, oh
    <br/>Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
    <br/>You're touchin' me
    <br/>Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
    <br/>Oh Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
    <br/>I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
    <br/>Usin' for the rest of my life, ohh-oh
    <br/>Don't blame me, love made me crazy
    <br/>If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (doin' it right, no)
    <br/>Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
    <br/>I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (oh)
    <br/>Don't blame me, love made me crazy (ooh)
    <br/>If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (you ain't doin' it right)
    <br/>Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
    <br/>I'll be usin' for (I'll be usin') the rest of my life (I'll be usin')
    <br/>I get so high, oh
    <br/>Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
    <br/>You're lovin' me
    <br/>Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>I don't like your little games
    <br>Don't like your tilted stage
    <br>The role you made me play of the fool
    <br>No, I don't like you
    <br>I don't like your perfect crime
    <br>How you laugh when you lie
    <br>You said the gun was mine
    <br>Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)
    <br>But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
    <br>Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
    <br>I got a list of names, and yours is in red, underlined
    <br>I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
    <br>Ooh, look what you made me do
    <br>Look what you made me do
    <br>Look what you just made me do
    <br>Look what you just made me...
    <br>Ooh, look what you made me do
    <br>Look what you made me do
    <br>Look what you just made me do
    <br>Look what you just made me do
    <br>I (I) don't (don't) like your kingdom keys (keys)
    <br>They (they) once belonged to me (me)
    <br>You (you) asked me for a place to sleep
    <br>Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)
    <br>The world moves on, another day another drama, drama
    <br>But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
    <br>And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
    <br>Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours
    <br>But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time (nick of time)
    <br>Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time (I do it all the time)
    <br>I got a list of names, and yours is in red, underlined
    <br>I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
    <br>Ooh, look what you made me do
    <br>Look what you made me do
    <br>Look what you just made me do
    <br>Look what you just made me...
    <br>Ooh, look what you made me do
    <br>Look what you made me do
    <br>Look what you just made me do
    <br>Look what you just made me do
    <br>I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
    <br>I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
    <br>I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
    <br>I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
    <br>I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
    <br>I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
    <br>I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
    <br>I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
    <br>I'm sorry
    <br>But the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
    <br>Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead (oh)
    <br>Ooh, look what you made me do
    <br>Look what you made me do
    <br>Look what you just made me do
    <br>Look what you just made me...
    <br>Ooh, look what you made me do

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>You should take it as a compliment
    <br>That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
    <br>You should think about the consequence
    <br>Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
    <br>And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
    <br>He's in the club doing, I don't know what
    <br>You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)
    <br>Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
    <br>You've ruined my life, by not being mine
    <br>You're so gorgeous
    <br>I can't say anything to your face
    <br>'Cause look at your face (gorgeous)
    <br>And I'm so furious
    <br>At you for making me feel this way
    <br>But what can I say?
    <br>You're gorgeous
    <br>You should take it as a compliment
    <br>That I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)
    <br>And you should think about the consequence
    <br>Of you touching my hand in the darkened room (dark room, dark room)
    <br>If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
    <br>But if you're single that's honestly worse
    <br>'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
    <br>(Honey, it hurts)
    <br>Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
    <br>I feel like I might sink and drown and die
    <br>You're so gorgeous
    <br>I can't say anything to your face (to your face)
    <br>'Cause look at your face (look at your face)
    <br>And I'm so furious
    <br>At you for making me feel this way (this way)
    <br>But what can I say?
    <br>You're gorgeous
    <br>You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah
    <br>There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
    <br>You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (mmh)
    <br>You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah
    <br>There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
    <br>Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (yeugh)
    <br>Alone, unless you wanna come along (oh)
    <br>You're so gorgeous
    <br>I can't say anything to your face (to your face)
    <br>'Cause look at your face (look at your face, gorgeous)
    <br>And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
    <br>At you for making me feel this way (feel this way)
    <br>But what can I say? (I say)
    <br>You're gorgeous
    <br>You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah
    <br>There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
    <br>You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (mmh)
    <br>You're gorgeous
    <br>You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah (it turns back so sad)
    <br>There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (what I can have)
