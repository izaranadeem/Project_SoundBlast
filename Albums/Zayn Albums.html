    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>I've been drinking absinthe, I just did the math
    <br/>It ain't addin' up, I've had enough of
    <br/>Runnin' 'round this board game, you can know your own name
    <br/>I won't give it up
    <br/>Am I crazy? Am I foolish?
    <br/>Am I stupid for playing these games with you?
    <br/>If I told you I loved you, would you say that it's f- up?
    <br/>If I told you they're flying, would you say that you looked up?
    <br/>Don't take me for what I'm sayin', just take me for what I am
    <br/>'Cause this is where I'm stayin', my two feet are in the sand
    <br/>I've been reading old - and I can't make sense of it
    <br/>Ain't no conspiracy that can save me
    <br/>Livin' in the moment feels good to me 'til it hurts
    <br/>And I need somebody
    <br/>Am I crazy? Am I foolish?
    <br/>Am I stupid for playing these games with you?
    <br/>If I told you I loved you, would you say that it's f- up?
    <br/>If I told you they're flying, would you say that you looked up?
    <br/>Don't take me for what I'm sayin', just take me for what I am
    <br/>'Cause this is where I'm stayin', my two feet are in the sand
    <br/>Take me as I am, I'm tired of dancin'
    <br/>Around the point
    <br/>Sharp and it is jagged like the shape of glass
    <br/>And it steals my voice
    <br/>If I told you I loved you, would you say that it's f- up?
    <br/>If I told you they're flying, would you say that you looked up? (Looked up)
    <br/>Don't (don't) take me for what I'm sayin', just take me for what I am
    <br/>'Cause this is where I'm stayin', my two feet are in the sand
    <br/>If I told you I loved you, would you say that it's f- up?
    <br/>If I told you they're flying, would you say that you looked up?
    <br/>Don't take me for what I'm sayin', just take me for what I am
    <br/>'Cause this is where I'm stayin', my two feet are in the sand</p>

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>No two people are the same
    <br/>Stand beside you, but just far enough away
    <br/>Last night we were drinking
    <br/>Tried to think away the pain
    <br/>Made that age-old mistake
    <br/>Tried to disconnect my body
    <br/>From my soul, from my soul
    <br/>See, I feel alright already on my own
    <br/>Can you let me be
    <br/>Intoxicated on my own?
    <br/>Do I need to answer?
    <br/>Or right my wrongs?
    <br/>Am I home if I don't know this place?
    <br/>And I've been feeling alienated
    <br/>On my spaceship alone
    <br/>Say goodbye to the past
    <br/>Leave it all with a laugh
    <br/>'Cause you always was right all along
    <br/>Know my reasons for the pain
    <br/>But if you brought it in front of me
    <br/>I know I'd do it all again
    <br/>Call them, but you can't get in
    <br/>I know from all the years
    <br/>That my feelings never change
    <br/>Can you let me be
    <br/>Intoxicated on my own?
    <br/>Do I need to answer?
    <br/>Or right my wrongs?
    <br/>Am I home if I don't know this place?
    <br/>And I've been feeling alienated
    <br/>On my spaceship alone
    <br/>Say goodbye to the past
    <br/>Leave it all with a laugh
    <br/>'Cause you always was right all along
    <br/>Did the winds make the noise of change?
    <br/>Can the wings on your skin help you fly away?
    <br/>'Cause it's always raining
    <br/>And the clouds are always gray when you're away
    <br/>Yeah, I've been feeling alienated
    <br/>On my spaceship alone
    <br/>Say goodbye to the past (ayy, ayy)
    <br/>Leave it all with a laugh
    <br/>'Cause you always was right all along
    <br/>All along
    <br/>Say goodbye to the past
    <br/>Say goodbye
    <br/>Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
    <br/>Ah, ah-ah</p>

    <p>So when I wake up today
    <br/>Hoping I don't feel the same as I did last night
    <br/>Shit-faced, not knowing which way is up
    <br/>Or down, or sideways, I'm frowning anyway
    <br/>Please give me one more day of happiness
    <br/>I need it, I need it
    <br/>Please give me one more day of happiness
    <br/>I need it, I need it
    <br/>Please give me one more day
    <br/>I need it, I need it
    <br/>Wake up and break up again
    <br/>Fight and hope we make up again
    <br/>Know when something's wrong, but something inside tells me it's all okay
    <br/>Even if it's strange, it's our love
    <br/>Please give me one more day of happiness
    <br/>I need it, I need it
    <br/>Please give me one more day of happiness
    <br/>I need it, I need it
    <br/>When I think of things lost
    <br/>Think of her love
    <br/>Took my foot off the pedal
    <br/>Think it's all suss
    <br/>Ain't one to make a fuss
    <br/>I don't need any medals
    <br/>Please give me one more day of happiness
    <br/>I need it, I need it
    <br/>Please give me one more day of happiness
    <br/>I need it, I need it
    <br/>Please give me one more day
    <br/>From this place I'm running from
    <br/>I hope I kept my grace
    <br/>From this place I'm running from
    <br/>I hope I kept my grace
    <br/>From this place I'm running from
    <br/>I know I can't escape
    <br/>I can't escape</p>
