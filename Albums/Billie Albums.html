    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>To take my love away
    <br/>When I come back around, will I know what to say?
    <br/>Said you won't forget my name
    <br/>Not today, not tomorrow
    <br/>Kinda strange, feelin' sorrow
    <br/>I got change (yup), you could borrow (borrow)
    <br/>When I come back around, will I know what to say?
    <br/>Not today, maybe tomorrow
    <br/>Open up the door, can you open up the door?
    <br/>I know you said before you can't cope with any more
    <br/>You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
    <br/>I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?
    <br/>Did you take
    <br/>My love away
    <br/>From me? Me
    <br/>Me
    <br/>Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away
    <br/>Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face
    <br/>Said, "I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break"
    <br/>How come when I returned, you were gone away?
    <br/>I don't, I don't know why I called
    <br/>I don't know you at all
    <br/>I don't know you
    <br/>Not at all
    <br/>I don't, I don't know why I called
    <br/>I don't know you at all
    <br/>I don't know you
    <br/>Did you take
    <br/>My love away
    <br/>From me? Me
    <br/>And that's when you found me
    <br/>I was waitin' in the garden
    <br/>Contemplatin', beg your pardon
    <br/>But there's a part of me that recognizes you
    <br/>Do you feel it too?
    <br/>When you told me it was serious
    <br/>Were you serious? Mm
    <br/>They told me they were only curious
    <br/>Now it's serious, hm
    <br/>Open up the door, can you open up the door?
    <br/>I know you said before you can't cope with any more
    <br/>You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
    <br/>I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?
    <br/>Wringing my hands in my lap
    <br/>And they tell me it's all been a trap
    <br/>And you don't know if you'll make it back
    <br/>I said, "No, don't say that"
    <br/>Hm-hm

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>I can't fall in love with you
    <br>I've been overseas
    <br>I've been havin' dreams
    <br>You were in the foyer
    <br>I was on my knees
    <br>Outside of my body
    <br>Watchin' from above
    <br>I see the way you want me
    <br>I wanna be the one, oh
    <br>But I gotta be careful
    <br>Gotta watch what I say
    <br>God, I hope it all goes away
    <br>'Cause I can't fall in love with you
    <br>No matter how bad that I want to
    <br>Mm
    <br>Ah-oh, uh, uh
    <br>Ah-oh, uh, uh
    <br>Mm
    <br>I don't need to breathe when you look at me, all I see is green
    <br>And I think that we're in between everything I've seen
    <br>In my dream, have it once a week, can't land on my feet
    <br>Can't sleep, have you underneath all of my beliefs
    <br>Keep it brief
    <br>I'll wait in the suite
    <br>Keep me off my feet, mm
    <br>You seem so paranoid
    <br>I'm looking at the boys
    <br>I've never filled the void
    <br>Out of spite
    <br>You seem so paralyzed
    <br>It's so romanticized
    <br>If this is how I die
    <br>That's alright
    <br>I've been overseas
    <br>I don't need to breathe when you look at me, all I see is green
    <br>And I think that we're in between everything I've seen
    <br>In my dream, have it once a week, can't land on my feet
    <br>And I've been overseas (can't sleep)
    <br>Have you underneath all of my beliefs
    <br>Keep it brief (so brief)
    <br>I'll see you in the suite (in the suite)
    <br>We can be discrete (ah)
    <br>But I've been overseas
    <br>And I've been havin' dreams
    <br>L'amour de ma vie
    <br>Love so bittersweet, mm
    <br>Open up the door for me
    <br>For me
    <br>'Cause I'm still on my knees
    <br>I'm stayin' off my feet, oh
    <br>I got you
    <br>I just want you to touch me
    <br>Come on
    <br>I know it seems to be the beginning
    <br>Listen up, hm
    <br>I want you to keep on doing it
    <br>It's something I don't know
    <br>I've never paid this much attention to you, ever.

    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>I want you to stay
    <br>'Til I'm in the grave
    <br>'Til I rot away, dead and buried
    <br>'Til I'm in the casket you carry
    <br>If you go, I'm going too, uh
    <br>'Cause it was always you, alright
    <br>And if I'm turning blue, please don't save me
    <br>Nothing left to lose without my baby
    <br>Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know
    <br>I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
    <br>Can't change the weather, might not be forever
    <br>But if it's forever, it's even better
    <br>And I don't know what I'm crying for
    <br>I don't think I could love you more
    <br>It might not be long, but baby, I
    <br>I'll love you 'til the day that I die
    <br>'Til the day that I die
    <br>'Til the light leaves my eyes
    <br>'Til the day that I die
    <br>I want you to see, hm
    <br>How you look to me, hm
    <br>You wouldn't believe if I told ya
    <br>You would keep the compliments I throw ya
    <br>But you're so full of shit, uh
    <br>Tell me it's a bit, oh
    <br>Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
    <br>Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid
    <br>And I don't know what I'm crying for
    <br>I don't think I could love you more
    <br>Might not be long, but baby, I
    <br>Don't wanna say goodbye
    <br>Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('til the day that I die)
    <br>I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone ('til the light leaves my eyes)
    <br>Can't change the weather, might not be forever ('til the day that I die)
    <br>But if it's forever, it's even better
    <br>I knew you in another life
    <br>You had that same look in your eyes
    <br>I love you, don't act so surprised
